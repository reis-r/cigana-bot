# cigana-bot
A "fortune" bot for Telegram Messenger.

This repository contains most of the source code for the "Cigana" (meaning "gypsy") bot, hosted at Heroku and available at https://telegram.me/cigana_bot.
The bot is a simple "fortune" program, it chooses randomly between a set of objects (called "cards") and returns one of them. Only one card per user can be drawed daily. The bot itself is programmed to output data in portuguese.
